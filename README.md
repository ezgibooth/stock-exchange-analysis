# stock-exchange-analysis

This script looks through all the stocks for one year and outputs:

    1. The ticker symbol,
    2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year,
    3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year,
    4. The total stock volume of the stock
    5. The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

The VBA script then runs on every worksheet (for each year)
